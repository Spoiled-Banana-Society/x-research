            Participation in best ball drafts requires a <strong>Draft Pass</strong>. Draft Passes may be obtained by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Purchasing them directly through the Platform using supported payment methods.</li>
            <li>Receiving free passes through promotions, referral bonuses, or the Banana Wheel.</li>
            <li>Earning them as prizes from completed contests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>All Draft Pass purchases are final.</strong> Refunds are issued only at our sole discretion in cases of
            technical failure that prevented participation in a draft. Entry fees collected from Draft Pass purchases fund
            the prize pools for each contest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Platform charges a <strong>rake</strong> (service fee) on each draft entry, which is disclosed on the draft
            lobby page before you join. Prize pool distributions are displayed before draft entry.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Payouts:</strong> Based on final standings at the end of the NFL season.</li>
            <li><strong>Jackpot Drafts:</strong> Special high-value prize pools triggered within batches of 100 drafts.</li>
            <li><strong>Hall of Fame (HOF) Entries:</strong> Bonus competition entries awarded within draft batches.</li>
            <li><strong>Banana Wheel Prizes:</strong> Instant prizes from the Banana Wheel spin feature.</li>

            Prizes are credited to your account balance. Withdrawals are subject to identity verification and

          <p>
            SBS uses a <strong>provably fair random number generation (RNG) system</strong> for draft order determination,
            Banana Wheel spins, Jackpot selection, and Hall of Fame entry selection. Our system operates on a
            cryptographic <strong>commit-reveal scheme</strong> using HMAC-SHA256:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Commit Phase:</strong> Before each random event, the server generates a cryptographic seed and publishes a hash commitment (SHA-256 of the seed).</li>
            <li><strong>Reveal Phase:</strong> After the event, the original seed is revealed. Anyone can verify that hashing the revealed seed produces the published commitment.</li>
            <li><strong>Deterministic Output:</strong> The random outcome is deterministically derived from the seed, meaning the result was fixed at commit time and could not be altered after the fact.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Verification is available for all RNG events via our public API endpoint. Each event is stored with its
            commitment hash, revealed seed, and computed result for independent audit. We believe transparency in
            randomness is essential to fair competition.
