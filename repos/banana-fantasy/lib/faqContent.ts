        question: 'What is Best Ball fantasy football?',
        answer: 'Best Ball is a set-it-and-forget-it fantasy format. After you draft your team, the platform automatically starts your highest-scoring players each week. No lineup management, no waivers, no trades to worry about - just draft and watch your team compete all season.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does Best Ball scoring work?',
        answer: 'Each week, your best players at each position are automatically selected based on their actual performance. Your weekly score is the sum of your best performers according to your roster requirements (1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 Flex, 1 DST, plus 7 bench).',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I trade or drop players after drafting?',
        answer: 'No trades or waivers in Best Ball - that\'s the beauty of it! However, because your teams are tradeable digital assets, you can sell your entire team on our marketplace at any time during the season if you want out.',

    items: [
      {
        question: 'What are Team Positions?',
        answer: 'Instead of drafting individual players like Patrick Mahomes, you draft Team Positions like "KC QB". Each week, you automatically get the points from the highest-scoring player at that position for that team. Draft KC QB and you get whoever scores most - Mahomes, the backup, whoever plays.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why draft Team Positions instead of players?',
        answer: 'You\'re never out of it. In traditional fantasy, one injury can destroy your season. With Team Positions, if a starter gets hurt, you automatically get points from whoever replaces them. Your team stays competitive all season regardless of injuries.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does this add strategy?',
        answer: 'Team Positions add a unique strategic layer. You\'re evaluating team depth, offensive systems, and coaching tendencies instead of just individual talent. A team with a great backup QB might be more valuable than one without.',

        question: 'Is this like a traditional 12-man redraft league?',
        answer: 'No - this is a tournament contest, not a season-long league with friends. You draft a team against 9 other players, and top finishers advance through playoffs to compete for a massive shared prize pool. You can draft as many teams as you want.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does a draft work?',
        answer: 'Drafts are 10-person leagues with 15 rounds using a snake draft format (pick order reverses each round). You have 30 seconds per pick. Drafts start immediately when 10 players join - no scheduled times to wait for.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens when I enter a draft?',
        answer: 'You join a room that fills to 10 players. Once full, a 60-second countdown starts and your draft type is revealed slot machine style - Jackpot (1%), HOF (5%), or Pro (94%). Then you draft!',
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between Fast and Slow drafts?',
        answer: 'Fast drafts have a 30-second pick clock - the whole draft takes about 15-20 minutes. Slow drafts give you 8 hours per pick, perfect if you want to draft over a few days.',

      },
      {
        question: 'How does defense/special teams scoring work?',

      {
        question: 'What is a Jackpot Draft?',
        answer: 'Jackpot Drafts are the rarest and most valuable draft type (1% of all drafts). If you win your league in a Jackpot draft, you skip straight to the finals, bypassing two weeks of playoffs. It\'s a massive shortcut to the grand prize.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I get into a Jackpot Draft?',
        answer: 'Every draft has a chance to become a Jackpot. When your draft room fills to 10/10 players, the slot machine reveals your draft type. You can also win guaranteed Jackpot entries on the Banana Wheel.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the guaranteed distribution work?',
        answer: 'This is NOT random odds - it\'s a guaranteed distribution system. Every 100 drafts contains exactly 1 Jackpot, 5 Hall of Fame, and 94 Pro drafts. The order is randomized, but the distribution is guaranteed. You\'re not gambling on luck - fair distribution is ensured for all players.',

        question: 'What exactly happens if I win a Jackpot league?',
        answer: 'Win your 10-person Jackpot league during the regular season (Weeks 1-14) and you advance directly to the Week 17 finals, skipping the Week 15 and Week 16 playoff rounds entirely. You get a direct shot at the grand prize.',

        question: 'What is a HOF (Hall of Fame) Draft?',
        answer: 'HOF Drafts are premium draft rooms (5% of all drafts) that compete for a separate bonus prize pool on top of the regular tournament prizes. Your team earns a special HOF badge and is eligible for exclusive end-of-season bonuses.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How is HOF different from Jackpot?',
        answer: 'Jackpot winners skip to finals (advancement perk). HOF leagues compete for additional bonus prizes on top of regular rewards (prize perk). You can win both regular tournament prizes AND HOF bonuses in the same season.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the odds of getting a HOF draft?',
        answer: 'HOF drafts make up 5% of all drafts. With the guaranteed distribution system, every 100 drafts contains exactly 5 HOF drafts. The order is randomized, but you\'re guaranteed fair distribution.',

        question: 'What can I win?',
