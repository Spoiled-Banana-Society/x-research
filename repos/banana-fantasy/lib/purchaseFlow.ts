/**
 * Module-level purchase flow store.
 *
 * The card path opens an external Privy/MoonPay window, then awaits a USDC
 * top-up, then runs the mint. That whole sequence can take ~30s. If state
 * lived in BuyPassesModal's React state, closing/reopening the modal would
 * unmount the component and reset everything — the user comes back to a
 * blank "buy passes" form with no idea whether their card was charged.
 *
 * This singleton lets the modal remount and resume rendering whatever step
 * the in-flight purchase is on. Reads via useSyncExternalStore.
