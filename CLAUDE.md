# Banana Fantasy — Shared Workspace

Bridge between Boris and Richard. Both work on banana-fantasy from their own machines using personal branches to avoid conflicts. Keep this file tight — if something is resolved or lives in code, don't write it here.

## Shared Workspace Sync (Read First)

### Branch Structure
- `main` — deployable code, only receives merges. **NEVER commit directly to main.**
- `boris` — Boris's working branch.
- `richard` — Richard's working branch.

### At the START of every session:
```bash
cd ~/sbs-claude-shared-workspace
git fetch origin
git checkout <your-branch>          # boris or richard
git pull origin <your-branch>
git merge origin/main --no-edit     # get the other person's deployed work
```

### At the END of every session (after ANY changes):
```bash
cd ~/sbs-claude-shared-workspace
git add <specific files>            # never -A or .
git commit -m "<Name>: <short>"
git push origin <your-branch>
```

### To deploy:
```bash
cd ~/sbs-claude-shared-workspace
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main --no-edit
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git merge <your-branch> --no-edit && git push origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
```
Then push to `sbs-frontend-v2` (banana-fantasy remote) to trigger Vercel.

### ⛔ Git Commit Safety (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Richard's commits have overwritten Boris's work multiple times from stale local files. Every commit, every time:

1. **`git pull origin main`** before committing — your local copies of files you didn't edit are stale.
2. **Only stage files you actually changed** — `git add <specific-files>`. **NEVER `git add -A` or `git add .`**.
3. **Before pushing, verify:** `git diff --stat HEAD~1`. If you see files you didn't touch, stop — you're about to overwrite someone's work.
4. If pushing to sbs-frontend-v2: `cd ~/banana-fantasy && git pull origin main` there too before committing.

### Pre-Push Hook (MANDATORY — set up once per machine)
Blocks pushes unless the other person's latest commits have been synced. Marker must be the actual commit hash — can't be faked with `touch`:

```bash
# Richard: OTHER_BRANCH=boris ; Boris: OTHER_BRANCH=richard
OTHER_BRANCH="<other>"
cat > ~/banana-fantasy/.git/hooks/pre-push << HOOKEOF
#!/bin/bash
SHARED=~/sbs-claude-shared-workspace
MARKER=~/banana-fantasy/.last-richard-sync
LATEST=\$(cd "\$SHARED" && git fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null && git rev-parse origin/${OTHER_BRANCH} 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "\$LATEST" ]; then echo "⛔ Could not fetch origin/${OTHER_BRANCH}."; exit 1; fi
if [ ! -f "\$MARKER" ]; then echo "⛔ Sync first. Latest: \$LATEST"; exit 1; fi
SYNCED=\$(cat "\$MARKER" 2>/dev/null)
if [ "\$SYNCED" != "\$LATEST" ]; then
  echo "⛔ ${OTHER_BRANCH} has new commits (\$LATEST) since your sync (\$SYNCED)."
  exit 1
fi
echo "✓ Sync verified (\${LATEST:0:7})"
HOOKEOF
chmod +x ~/banana-fantasy/.git/hooks/pre-push
```

After syncing:
```bash
cd ~/sbs-claude-shared-workspace && git rev-parse origin/<other> > ~/banana-fantasy/.last-richard-sync
```

### Tests Before Deploy (run when practical)
- Preferred: `cd ~/sbs-claude-shared-workspace/repos/banana-fantasy && npx playwright test e2e/draft-room.spec.ts`
- Run when a change plausibly affects draft-room behavior or drafting page.
- Skip for config-only, docs, or pure backend patches the frontend doesn't exercise.
- If tests fail because of the diff: fix before deploying.

## Company & Product

- **Company:** Spoiled Banana Society (SBS), founded 2021. `sbsfantasy.com`.
- **Product:** Onchain fantasy football (best ball format) on Base chain.
- **Current Season:** Banana Best Ball 4.
- **NFT Collection:** `opensea.io/collection/banana-best-ball-3`.
- **Team:** Boris Vagner (cofounder, product/vision) · Richard Vagner (cofounder) · Dev (full-stack, limited availability).

### What is Best Ball?
- Draft a team, hands off for the season. System auto-picks each week's best scoring players.
- Similar to Underdog Fantasy. No lineup management.
- Draft starts immediately when 10 players join.

### Draft Format
- **Snake draft, team-position-based** — draft "KC QB", not "Patrick Mahomes". Each week you get the highest-scoring player from that team's position slot.
- 10 players per draft. 15 rounds.
- **Fast drafts:** 30 seconds per pick.
- **Slow drafts:** 8 hours per pick (Go API returns `pickLength: 28800`).

### Draft Types (Guaranteed Distribution)
| Type | Per 100 | Color | Perk |
|------|---------|-------|------|
| Jackpot | 1 | Red `#ef4444` | Win league → skip to finals |
| HOF | 5 | Gold `#D4AF37` | Bonus prizes on top of regular rewards |
| Pro | 94 | Purple `#a855f7` | Standard |

Not random odds — guaranteed distribution per 100 drafts. Users don't know type until the draft fills (slot machine reveal). Backend owns the batch tracker (`models/leagues.go` → `DraftLeagueTracker`). Frontend reads `GET /league/batchProgress`.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind. Repo: `banana-fantasy`.
- **Backend:** Go APIs on Cloud Run. `sbs-drafts-api` (REST) + `SBS-Football-Drafts` (WebSocket).
- **Data:** Firebase Realtime DB (live draft state) + Firestore (users, purchases, notifications, pass_origin, admin audit).
- **Auth:** Privy (embedded wallets + external wallets).
- **Chain:** Base mainnet (chain id 8453).
- **Payments:** $25 USDC on Base. Card via Coinbase Onramp (Privy `useFundWallet`, `preferredProvider: 'moonpay'` historically — currently Coinbase).
- **Push notifications:** OneSignal (app `SBS Fantasy`, Vercel vars `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` + `ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY`).

## Design
- Apple-esque: clean, minimal, premium. Dark theme, subtle glows, glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-xl` + soft borders).
- Brand color: `#fbbf24` (banana yellow).
- Tailwind custom colors: `jackpot #ef4444`, `hof #D4AF37`, `pro #a855f7` + glow variants.
- CSS utilities (`globals.css`): `.glow-jackpot` / `.glow-hof` / `.glow-pro` / `.glow-banana` / `.hof-gold-filter` / `.glass-card`.
- Product should feel like a polished web2 fantasy app with web3 superpowers under the hood.

## Smart Contract
- **BBB4 draft pass NFT:** `0x14065412b3A431a660e6E576A14b104F1b3E463b` on Base.
- **USDC on Base:** `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`.
- Public `mint(numberOfTokens)` — user pays $25 USDC per pass.
- `reserveTokens(address, numberOfTokens)` — `onlyOwner` admin mint, no USDC. Used for admin grants + wheel prize + promo rewards.
- Owner wallet: `0xccdF79A51D292CF6De8807Abc1bB58D07D26441D` (private key in Vercel env `BBB4_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY`). Reserve for multisig handoff before prod volume.
- Origin of free mints tracked in Firestore `pass_origin/{tokenId}` so marketplace rule (free passes can't list until season closes) can join against it.

## Do-Not-Reintroduce Rules

### Draft Room Race Conditions
- **draftId race:** URL has no draftId — `joinDraft` sets it async. The "at 10" effect MUST guard `if (isLiveMode && !draftId) return` and include `draftId` in deps.
- **Poll race:** 2.5s poll must NOT set `draftOrder` during filling — only `playerCount`. The "at 10" effect owns the randomize transition.

### Chain + payments
- Entry fee is $25 USDC on Base. Never hard-code 0x1234… mock wallets into user resolution — admin grant must mint to the admin-typed recipient.

### Marketplace listing rule
- `team.passType === 'free'` + `isDraftingOpen()` → block listing with "Available After Season" (`components/marketplace/SellTab.tsx`, `app/marketplace/page.tsx`). Needs server-side enforcement before real volume — currently client-only.

## Current Open Threads

See `NOTES-FOR-RICHARD.md` and `NOTES-FOR-BORIS.md` for active coordination between us. Keep those dated and trim resolved items.

## When You Ship Something
- Update this file when you add new conventions, move addresses, change deploy commands, or set do-not-reintroduce rules.
- Do NOT dump session notes here. Those go in `NOTES-FOR-*.md`.
- Trim aggressively — if the history is in git log or in the code, don't re-describe it here.
